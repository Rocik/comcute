The chapter proposes additional solutions that can be implemented within the Comcute system to increase its configurability. This refers to configuration of the reliability level in the W and S server layers, static or on-the-fly data partitioning and integration, configuration of the system for processing in the data streaming fashion, extending the system for selection of a project that the client wants to contribute to, ease of migration of legacy codes to the system. Finally, an example of a legacy distributed application for monitoring client locations and resource usage is presented with suggestions on its migration to the Comcute system environment.
