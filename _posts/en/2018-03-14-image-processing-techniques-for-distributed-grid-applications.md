In this chapter, parallel approaches to 2D and 3D convolution processing of series of images have been presented. A distributed, practically oriented, 2D spatial convolution scheme has been elaborated and extended into the temporal domain. Complexity of the scheme has been determined and analysed with respect to coefficients in convolution kernels. Possibilities of parallelisation of the convolution operations have been analysed and the results presented. Serial and parallel variants of 2D convolution schemes are proposed and their time-cost trade-offs are discussed. Flexibility of the solution with regard to scalable size of the kernel has been highlighted. The image processing techniques are analysed with respect to be applied in active distributed grid processing systems in the Internet, and their direct orientation toward the Comcute system has been deliberatively spotlighted.
