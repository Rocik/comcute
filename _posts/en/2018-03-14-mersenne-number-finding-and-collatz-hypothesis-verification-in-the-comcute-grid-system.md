In this chapter, some mathematic applications have been described to test scalability of the Comcute grid system. Especially, a verification of the Collatz hypothesis and finding Mersenne numbers were applied to prove the scalability and high performance of this grid system. Results were compared with outcomes obtained by the other grid systems.
